1. Since frontend will be built on top of a SPA architecture implementing JWT will be the way to go, or at least, that's what I've been told.

2. Passport will need to be modularized a bit.

3. Fixing scripts so yarn install no longer fires every time tests are made will be great.

4. There's still no way to validate the login on the frontend. Time to fix that.
